# Movie Reviewer Website
This app was a project to have a database (Relation and NoSQL) and a front end interact through some persistent dataset and user interaction.

We developed a small app which has data on movies, which we just used a random data generator to populate, and users which can rate the movies. 
If the user has an account they can login, and then within the app they can search and review movies within the database. This involves a rating, and leaving comments.
The front end of this app was developed in C# through forms.

This site did not focus on security, as it was more based around the database interations. 
Do not use the current login system without implementing security.
