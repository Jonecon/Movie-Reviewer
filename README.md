# Movie Reviewer Website
This website was a project to have a database (Relation and NoSQL) and a front end interact through some persistent dataset and user interaction.

We developed a small website which has data on movies, which we just used a random data generator to populate, and user which can rate the movies. 
The user can create an account, and then within the app they can search and review movies within the database. This involves a rating, and leaving comments.

This site did not focus on security, as it was more based around the database interations. 
Do not use the current login system without implementing security.
